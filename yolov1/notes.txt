- Paper: "You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection" by Redmon et al. (2016)

- image is divided into S x S grid
- predict 1 set of class probabilities per grid cell
- for each grid cell predicts B bounding boxes, confidence for boxes, and C class probabilities
- 24 convolutional layers followed by 2 fully connected layers


- goal: maximize average precision
- 


using paper needs to implment:

- layers of model
- optimization function
- linear activation function
- hyperparameters
-
